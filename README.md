## A repo

This repo is for my CIS256 module 8 assignment. 

## A git haiku. 

Branches intertwine,  
Commits mark the path we tread,  
History preserved.

## A poem about python

Python’s rhythm flows, smooth and bright,  
Indentations guiding right,  
With loops and lists and simple might,  
Errors vanish out of sight.  


  
From import lines to function calls,  
Python scales both large and small,  
A language where we stand up tall,  
And answer every coder’s call.  



Data danced with nimble grace,  
Strings and numbers find their place,  
In Python’s world, a friendly space,  
Code with elegance and pace.



With every line, new doors appear,  
In Python’s syntax, crisp and clear,  
A joy to code, a tool so dear,  
For those who seek and persevere.
